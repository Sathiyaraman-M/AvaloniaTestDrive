# Avalonia Test Drive

A Simple Temperature Conversion Application with Avalonia UI.

Avalonia UI is a new modern .NET cross-platform application framework with C# and XAML, inspired by WPF

## First Impressions

- Incredible Tooling support (especially with Jetbrains Rider)
- Applications are extremely fast, compared to WinUI
- Fast build times, again compared to UWP and WinUI - WinUI have very slow first-time builds and throws random errors even when running the fresh created project 
- Easy to get going
- Intuitive Styling similar to CSS
- Little bit similar to vanilla WPF experience
- Thumbs-up for Windows support all the way to Windows 7 and again macOS and Linux support is a big-plus

I feel like the best
